# Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly looking to improve my skills and build practical applications. This project represents an exercise in creating a dynamic "Hello World" program, which is a fundamental first step in many programming journeys. By developing this software, I aim to deepen my understanding of Python programming and demonstrate how to create interactive scripts that respond to user input.

This software is a simple Python script that prints a personalized "Hello" message. It prompts the user to enter their name and responds with a custom greeting. If no name is provided, it defaults to "Hello, World!"

I have created a short video demonstrating the functionality of the software and providing a walkthrough of the code. You can view it using the link below:

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I utilized the following tools:

- **Python**: The programming language used to write the script.
- **Visual Studio Code**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding.
- **Git**: A version control system used to manage changes and collaborate on the project.
